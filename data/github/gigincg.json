This is an acceptable behaviour. In order to allow this, remove all data validation from the field\r\n\r\n@aparnacoronasafe I thought we finalized on dropping Validations for Both OP and IP Numbers.

I have read the problem statement and I am really interested to contribute to this project.\n> \n> \n> \n> I have read the project features to be implemented and I think my skills be really helpful for the project, as it's requirements align with my past experience, I have worked with developing chat bots before, I have developed a chat bot my self in a hackathon hosted my Morgan Stanley, I built it in a react native application. Additionally I have built telegram bots using Aiogram in python. I think my skills will be really helpful for the project.\n> \n> \n> \n> **Overview**:\n> \n> The project involves building a wrapper for the CARE platform to facilitate interaction via instant messaging (IM) bots, with a focus on improving user experience. Additionally, a WhatsApp bot will be developed to serve both patients and hospital staff, providing functionalities such as fetching patient records, medications, procedures, schedules, asset status, and inventory data.\n> \n> \n> \n> Roadmap:\n> \n> 1) Wrapper Development: Create IM wrapper API for CARE platform.\n> \n> 2) WhatsApp Bot Development: Build bot for patient and staff interaction with help of **TWILIO**.\n> \n> 3) Privacy Measures: Implement data protection measures.\n> \n> 4) Testing and Deployment: Test, deploy, and monitor.\n\n@NutNick31 Your Roadmap looks good as a very minimal overview. Please do make a detailed proposal to take up the project as part of GSoC.\n\nPlease note that we would prefer not to use Twilio but WhatsApp's official APIs. Also, ensure that your approach is modular enough such that the WhatsApp part is switchable with any other IM in the future"
