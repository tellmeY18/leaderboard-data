      "text": "The issue, it seems, still persists. I have researched more and found that the dark mode looks good but it is not working in Google Chrome browser. It works on Firefox (When user theme preferences have been set to dark theme). However, it seems to be a separate issue. \n\n> [@shantanuk7](https://github.com/shantanuk7) thanks for the issue. Do you want to take it up?\n\n@bodhish @sainak I apologise for not replying earlier. **I’d be happy to work on resolving the light mode issue if it’s still available for contribution.**"
