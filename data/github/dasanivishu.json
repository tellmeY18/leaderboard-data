      "text": "Hey @rithviknishad @vigneshhari, I am particularly intrigued by the CARE project and its objectives in revolutionizing healthcare management. The specific goal mentioned in the issue is to create different serializers for list and detail views to minimize joins and only send the required data to the front end. I find this approach fascinating as it optimizes performance and enhances the user experience by reducing unnecessary data retrieval.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful if you could provide me with more details regarding the specific tasks involved in implementing this feature. Could you please explain the process of identifying the view sets that require separate serializers for list and detail views? Additionally, it would be helpful to understand the steps involved in creating the list and detail serializers, as well as integrating them into the existing codebase.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your support. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\nBest Regards\r\nVishal Dasani"
