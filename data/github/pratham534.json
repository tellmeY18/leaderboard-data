      "text": "Hello @rithviknishad sir,\r\nI have read the complete issue and found it interesting to work on. I have been learning Python, Django, and Django REST Framework. Recently I also created a basic REST API using DRF for an e-commerce website while practicing and I would like to learn more by contributing to this project. I also am new to open-source contributions and would like to begin my journey under your guidance and support. \r\nI will be grateful if you provide me with an opportunity to be a part of your team and solve many such issues in coming future.\r\nThanks"
