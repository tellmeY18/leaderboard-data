      "text": "> @patelaryan7751 it seems like we are introducing quite a few hacks to manage something simple.\r\n> \r\n> It did work before without these many hacks before. Isn't it as simple as getting the filter state from query parama, resolving it to object by the parent component, passing the resolved filter objects to the FiltersSlideOver component without needing to manage too many states inside the FiltersSlideOver component itself as it's already managed by the parent?\r\n> \r\n> cc: @khavinshankar\r\n\r\n@rithviknishad Yes it is simple to just pass the query param to the filterState of respective advanced filters but there are fields that cannot be directly assigned from query params specifically the fields which are involving selecting facility from the dropdown. There is a different state variable prefix()_ref type in the filterState which contains all info of the selected facility we need to assign it to null in order to clear the advanced filter state when a badge is cleared. So, directly passing it to the parent state need some modifications, which I did, using useEffect hook . In simple terms, I am trying to sync the filterState of advanced filters with the query params when there is any change caused by badges outside. If there is any other method to do this then I can rework on it."

      "text": "> I believe that the intention of displaying the message \"Comment should contain at least 1 character\" to the user is to prevent mishaps where they user might accidently try to hit the \"Post comment\"/\"Add note\" button without actually filling the box.\r\n> \r\n> Sure, they can still bypass it by adding a space. But if we then add a check for the space, we would need to address dozens other ways where the user might try to post an empty comment. For example, using empty Unicode characters or even unintentional characters like a single dot or multiple spaces, tabs etc.\r\n> \r\n> Although adding this is a neat little change, I think it might be out of scope of the behavior we are expecting from the check there currently is (Which is only checking length of the TextField's value).\r\n> \r\n> TLDR; There would be many ways to bypass this check and it's main purpose should be limited to just nudging the user in case they hit submit without any text, accidently.\r\n> \r\n> Just my thoughts, would love to hear other opinions on this! smile\r\n\r\nYeah @Ashesh3 I completely agree on this but comment without anything looks a little unprofessional it can contain anything a dot or any single character but containing space can make it look empty :) Even in whatsapp try to send a message containing  \r\nonly spaces no character it would not allow you to send it. Having this check maybe a bit enhancement :smile: "
