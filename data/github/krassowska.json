My thinking is that it may be better fixing it on front-end, as on back-end it was working okay, it communicates with S3 so I'm not sure what implication would be for changing file name pattern. Front-end uses files taken from S3 and the code adding second \".pdf\" extension is a new addition so changing it should not cause much issues for the whole system.\r\n\r\nI saw that there were no tests for this part of code. Would you accept a pull request adding a test? I may have time over the weekend to add it."
