      "text": "Hello @sainak and @nihal467,\n\nI’m Siddhesh Sangale, a Computer Science student from Pune Institute of Computer Technology. With strong expertise in web development, particularly in Django and the MERN stack, I’ve worked on several projects to hone my skills. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute and would love to assist with Implementing Authentication for Requests and WebSockets as well as Writing Migrations to Align Existing Tables with Django Models.\n\nIf these issues are still open, I’d be thrilled to collaborate. Looking forward to your response!\n"
