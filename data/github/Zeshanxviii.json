To better understand the problem, could you please provide a video or screenshots that illustrate the current formatting issues, particularly the lack of spacing at the header and footer, and the page breaks between sentences?\r\n\r\nThis will help ensure that the proposed solutions address the issues effectively.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
