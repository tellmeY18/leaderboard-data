      "text": "Hello @nihal467  sir,\r\n\r\nI'm Giteshwar Dewangan, a pre-final year student at SSTC BHILAI. Fueled by curiosity in tech, I've delved into MERN stack projects and explored JavaScript, TypeScript, and React at Internsavy. During my internship, I crafted portfolios and contact projects.\r\n\r\nMy enthusiasm extends beyond GSoC participation; I'm genuinely keen on making substantial contributions to your project. I aim to create a positive impact, enhancing my experience and learning along the way.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate your guidance and support throughout this exciting opportunity.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nGiteshwar Dewangan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
