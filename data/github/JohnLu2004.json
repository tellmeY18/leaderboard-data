Then make the migrations and the migrations file, so that application logic and ORM are in sync with db. Also, should updating these fields every time someone modifies a user be in the PR as well? Right now, it seems we're just adding in 2 fields. Let me know your thoughts :)"

How do you feel about this approach on a high level?:\n\nUse a carrier lookup service to check whether the phone number is assigned to an active carrier. The overhead would be paying for a monthly service though. There are free tiers, but we would easily go over the monthly limit.\n\n\n\nWe could also try OTP, but I think we would run into issues if a medical staff is entering in someone's phone number instead of the person themselves."
