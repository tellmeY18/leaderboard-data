      "text": "This can be done in 3 phases :-\r\n\r\n1. Adding a new Table for storing logs : - here first make a structure you want to have for the table which will be storing all records, column names, their types and the table name. [ This will go into `prisma/schema.prisma`  file]\r\n\r\n2. Writing database helper functions that store the data: [Refer to `app/api/database/mapping/utils.ts` for an example on how to interact with the database and store entries in a table using code], then create a new folder `app/api/database/logging/utils.ts` and write the equivalent logic there for adding a log entry / updating it when something changes, no need to add support for deleting a log.\r\n\r\n3. Triggering this api call when the proceed button is pressed, and subsequently calling it again as and when the status changes (This can be discussed after step 1 and 2 are done), this involves making a fetch request to that newly added api endpoint. [ Example for api endpoint code `app/api/database/mapping/route.ts` , `app/api.ts` ]"

I have also implemented checks in between so if there is a row which does not contains any of the details like question or human_answer or language it simply does not add that data as well this helps in stopping the missing values to enter is this approach correct??? please give suggestions......\r\n\r\nApproach sounds good, let's get the design ready now!"

      "text": "We've discussed enhancing the `PatientRegistration` model to support a more flexible patient assignment system. The consensus is to move beyond the initial proposal of capping assignments to up to 3 doctors and 2 nurses per patient. Instead, we will implement a one-to-many relationship that allows for assigning any number of doctors or nurses as needed to a patient, thus removing any specific limitations on the number of care providers. This change will better accommodate the diverse needs of our TeleICU and homecare services and align with the requirements detailed in the discussion.\r\n\r\nIn addition to adjusting the model relationship, this update will necessitate both backend and frontend changes to support the enhanced functionality. This includes updates to authorization, filters, and any other necessary adjustments to ensure a smooth and functional implementation."

      "text": "It appears that the root of our SSL verification issue is indeed related to the use of underscores in domain names. \r\n\r\nI conducted some tests and found the following:\r\n- `test_abc.domain.com` - fails SSL verification\r\n- `abc.domain.com` - passes SSL verification\r\n\r\nThese tests were carried out on my Cloudflare domain around 5:45. \r\n\r\nFurther, I referred to the DigiCert knowledge base, which confirms that underscores are not allowed in Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs). Here's the link for reference: [DigiCert Knowledge Base](https://www.digicert.com/kb/ssl-support/underscores-not-allowed-in-fqdns.htm).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I checked the CA/Browser Forum's Ballot SC12 regarding the sunset of underscores in DNS names. The ballot has passed, clearly indicating a shift in standards concerning domain naming practices. You can find more details here: [CAB Forum - Ballot SC12](https://cabforum.org/2018/11/12/ballot-sc-12-sunset-of-underscores-in-dnsnames/).\r\n\r\nBased on these findings, it's evident that the issue lies in the use of underscores in the domain name, which is not compliant with SSL hostname matching standards. Therefore, this pull request will be closed as the problem does not stem from our code."

      "text": "Considerations while working on this issue:\r\n\r\n- Modify the login page to include a second step for 2FA. This could be a field for entering a verification code after successful verification of username and password combination.\r\n\r\n- 2FA method would be TOTP ( @bodhish can you confirm this? )\r\n\r\n- Integrate 2FA Library: For TOTP, integrate a library that supports it, such as PyOTP in Python at the backend.\r\n\r\n- At the time of account creation or through account settings, allow users to enroll in 2FA. This will involve generating a secret key for the user, which they can add to their authentication app. They should be able to add/remove 2FA at any time through their profile settings.\r\n\r\n- Offer fallback options like backup codes in case the user loses access to their 2FA device.\r\n\r\n- Store the secret key for TOTP securely in the database.\r\n\r\n- Consider rate limiting 2FA attempts to prevent brute force attacks.\r\n\r\n- Provide clear instructions and support for users to understand how to set up and use 2FA."

The issue is about hiding the feed tab for patients who have a linked bed to them but that linked bad has no camera asset attached to it.\r\n\r\nExample: https://care.coronasafe.in/facility/a3910fb7-db3d-4ddf-aa39-1f20e61d1453/patient/400cbedd-98d7-4f8f-b835-155ba71cc28d/consultation/6ae67a3d-305b-4404-bfd6-b21b0d0f8426\r\n\r\nThis patient has an attached bed without a camera, in this case the feed tab should be hidden:\r\n![image](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/assets/3626859/18248974-0ec7-44ac-819a-45245be372a9)\r\n\r\nThe bed's location is `NICU`\r\nHere's the corresponding asset: (same location)\r\nhttps://care.coronasafe.in/facility/a3910fb7-db3d-4ddf-aa39-1f20e61d1453/assets/ed2edbd7-4581-434e-8c6a-4620b4d0a4a0\r\n\r\nIt's an HL7 monitor and not a camera, there are no cameras in the same location as that bed, so the feed tab should be hidden.\r\n\r\n@nihal467 can you double check this message for any corrections?"

Are you suggesting that I create a new endpoint specifically for filtering users by facility and that this endpoint should be located under the detailed view of facilities? For example, `/facilities/<facility_id>/users`? Don't we already have a dedicated endpoint for this at: https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care/blob/master/care/users/api/viewsets/users.py#L218\r\n\r\nJust want to make sure I understand your suggestion correctly before implementing it."

The backend first creates an entry and returns the signed_url which is used on the frontend side to make the actual upload. If the upload fails, the backend has no way of knowing the same and frontend does nothing to remedy that. \r\n\r\nPossible fix: Currently all files have an attribute `upload_completed` which defaults to `False`. Once an upload is actually successful, the frontend can send a separate request to set that to `True`.\r\nThe file list on the frontend would then only show files which have `upload_completed = True`.\r\n\r\n@vigneshhari What's your take on this?"

      "text": "> Why isn't the package-lock changed?\r\n\r\nThat's a good question! Since we're using Yarn as our primary package manager, I've removed and added packages solely using `yarn` commands. It does not touch package-lock, instead it has it's own lock file `yarn.lock` which was indeed modified during this migration. So why isn't it there in this PR? 🤔 It's apparently ignored in the `.gitignore` file [here](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/blob/develop/.gitignore#L52).\r\nIt was recently added in [this commit](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/commit/6e53406f168d005caa5ba4a9747dd4bf25e2b320#diff-bc37d034bad564583790a46f19d807abfe519c5671395fd494d8cce506c42947R50-R52) (probably unintentionally)\r\n\r\nIdeally, it should be checked out to source control. \r\n\r\nhttps://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm\r\n\r\n> When you run either yarn or yarn add <package>, Yarn will generate a yarn.lock file within the root directory of your package. You don’t need to read or understand this file - just check it into source control. When other people start using Yarn instead of npm, the yarn.lock file will ensure that they get precisely the same dependencies as you have.\r\n\r\nI made a PR resolving the above issue here: #3545"

      "text": "> @Ashesh3 The UI is a bit confusing in small screens Can we have flex-col so that fields stack in mobile devices?\r\n\r\nI agree that the table is a bit hard to navigate on smaller screens but I am afraid I am aware of no better solution. MaterialUI Table does not allow us to display the cells stacked according to the screen size. \r\n\r\nhttps://mui.com/material-ui/api/table/\r\n\r\nAlthough we can indeed force the cells to stack, this might not achieve the best results:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626859/188512255-dff811d3-69dd-4d3c-ba16-316ea0ccdaf2.png)\r\n\r\nI believe that at it's current state (with this PR), it makes the table at least fully usable and represents it in an elegant manner.\r\nIf you know of any better way, feel free to suggest a change!

      "text": "I believe that the intention of displaying the message \"Comment should contain at least 1 character\" to the user is to prevent mishaps where they user might accidently try to hit the \"Post comment\"/\"Add note\" button without actually filling the box.\r\n\r\nSure, they can still bypass it by adding a space. But if we then add a check for the space, we would need to address dozens other ways where the user might try to post an empty comment. For example, using empty Unicode characters or even unintentional characters like a single dot or multiple spaces, tabs etc. \r\n\r\nAlthough adding this is a neat little change, I think it might be out of scope of the behavior we are expecting from the check there currently is (Which is only checking length of the TextField's value).\r\n\r\nTLDR; There would be many ways to bypass this check and it's main purpose should be limited to just nudging the user in case they hit submit without any text, accidently.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts, would love to hear other opinions on this! 😄 "
