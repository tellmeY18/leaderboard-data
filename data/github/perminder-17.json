      "text": "Hello @NNSiri , I appreciate the idea of incorporating the extensive range of occupation details you mentioned, as opposed to just a few. However, including such a vast amount of data in the drop-down menu might make our user interface appear cluttered, requiring users to scroll extensively to find their desired occupations. Perhaps we could brainstorm a design solution where users can start typing their occupation, and the system suggests relevant options, similar to the feature we have when adding patient details.\r\n![image](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/assets/127239756/3cd2ec30-e1c8-4a36-96fd-3b4adfccc1ab)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what are your thoughts on it? \r\n"
