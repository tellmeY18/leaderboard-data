      "text": "@nihal467 @aparnacoronasafe In this issue, we are synchronising the doctor types with available skills and using staff capacity instead of the doctor's list in the facility dashboard. I feel like we can completely go with the staff capacity in the facility dashboard and make corresponding changes to shift from displaying doctors to staff.The changes include \r\n- [ ] Changing the route names that we are using currently using to fetch staff details (`/api/v1/facility/{facilityId}/hospital_doctor/` and `/api/v1/facility/{facilityId}/hospital_doctor/{id}/`) for more readability \r\n- [ ] And also making changes in the frontend like, the notifications currently are displaying \"Doctor count added successfully\" and we can change them to \"Staff count added successfully\" and etc. \r\n- [ ] And also in frontend code can we change the variable names accordingly for more readability of the code as currently we are displaying the Staff details in facility dashboard instead of doctors details ?\r\n What do you think?
