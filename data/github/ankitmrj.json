      "text": "Hi @rithviknishad @NNSiri \r\nFeature Request: Enhanced Filtering for Users\r\n\r\nProblem Statement: Currently, in the Users section under Advanced Filters, there is no option to select specific Talukas, which limits our ability to efficiently manage and scale operations across Taluka Hospitals in Karnataka.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution: We request the implementation of a feature that allows users to filter based on Taluka. This would greatly benefit our organization as we expand our presence and operations within Karnataka.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\nEfficiency: Enables us to quickly identify and manage users associated with specific Talukas.\r\nScalability: Supports our growth strategy by facilitating management across multiple Taluka Hospitals.\r\nAccuracy: Ensures precise user targeting and management within designated geographic areas.\r\nAlternative Consideration: While we await this feature implementation, a temporary workaround could involve manually sorting and categorizing users based on Taluka information provided in their profiles. However, this manual approach is time-consuming and prone to errors, highlighting the necessity of an automated filtering feature.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my feature request. I believe that this enhancement will significantly improve our workflow and contribute to the overall effectiveness of the platform.\r\n\r\n"
