However moving away from the panel/button for a long time should technically close it. But it does make the issue kind of complex to deal with, which is why it was abstracted out to a separate issue from a parent issue.\r\nI think it is probably best not to delve into such complexity at this time for a small change, so the current solution you have presented works great. Looks good to me. Thank you for contributing!"

If it is not understandable I will change it to \"am/pm\"\r\n> We had an existing behavior where typing \"12092024\" would automatically format the input as 12/09/2024\r\n4. The existing behaviour made it easy to enter the date, but totally hard to update it. The reason it was removed was so that the user does not face this while editing the date:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7313c037-a439-4662-9cf0-5c038ecc50a4\r\n\r\nBecause this behaviour was changed, the tests were also changed.\r\n\r\n5. The input will auto reset if the entered time is not of the desired format.\r\n6. On mobile devices, the component can be scrolled left-right.
