Title of the card must be \"Perinatal Status\" containing the information on whether the patient is antenatal (date of last menstruation) and post-partum (with date of delivery)\r\n\r\nThe place where you are suggesting to add the \"Perinatal status\" card is only shown when a consultation if filed for patient. (check the link you provided - it says consultation). We are currently collecting the perinatal details per patient and not per consultation. So showing it only when consultation is created seems odd to me. I realized this only when writing tests that I'll have to first create a consultation in order to verify perinatal info.\r\n\r\nI think it'll be more appropriate to add the details in \"Medical\" card (see the screenshot). We are already showing is \"Is pregnant\" field there. Let me know what you think. Thanks.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/assets/56870381/c8d781b4-ebdf-4a62-a512-cde43392a0f5)\r\n"

The button has text \"Copy values from previous log\". If we use this to toggle, we need to change the button text also. What should the text be when button is used to toggle `clone_last` to false? \r\n\r\nPS: Still thinking checkbox is correct control here.

Idea was by clicking the button, form would get filled with previous log values.\r\n\r\nAfter you suggested to revert all changes and just add the description of what will happen I have added just that message \"Field values will be copied from previous log update\". The form no longer displays what values are being copied. The copying is going to happen entirely on backend. "

Correct me if wrong\r\n\r\n> Is a keyword that converts the first letter of each word to uppercase. Other characters remain unchanged (they retain their original case as written in the element's text).\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform\r\n\r\n`sampleDetails.status` can have value \"COMPLETED\". We need \"Completed\".  `capitalize` class won't do that. Similar issue for `sampleDetails.doctor_name` and maybe in other places.\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/wR1YZEkNsO\r\n\r\n"
