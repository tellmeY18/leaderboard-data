      "text": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI'm Kailai, a software engineering student with technique skills including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, Django, and more. I have some recent experience like developing a healthcare-related application and contributing to data analysis tools, which align closely with the goals of this project.  I'm passionate about improving healthcare through technology and excited about the opportunity to contribute to the CARE platform.\r\n\r\nI am keen to discuss some specific details of the project and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to converse with the contributors. Could you please inform me if there is an official platform for discussion, where we can delve into the details more thoroughly?"
