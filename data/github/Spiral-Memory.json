If mic permission is not there or blocked, the span will be visible to allow mic permission.\r\n2. In case permission is not there and only when the user clicks on 'Start Record', the popup will appear asking for mic permission.\r\n3. In case permission is blocked, the popup won't appear, and the span warning plus a toast message will be displayed.\r\n4. If mic permission is allowed, there won't be such a span warning.\""
