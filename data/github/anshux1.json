      "text": "@bodhish  I understand the sensitivity of data in healthcare systems. \r\n\r\nGiven this context, I propose the following approach:\r\n\r\n1. For the edit functionality:\r\n   - I'll open an issue in the backend repo to add a route for updating comments.\r\n   - Once that's implemented, we can add the edit feature to the frontend.\r\n\r\n2. For the delete functionality:\r\n   - Instead of deleting comments, we could implement a \"soft delete\" where comments are marked as retracted but still visible in the system.\r\n\r\nThis approach maintains data integrity while still giving users some control over their comments.\r\nShould i proceed with implementing the edit functionality and a modified version of the delete functionality?"
