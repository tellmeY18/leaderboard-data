I'm considering beginning the UI design process for CITIZEN, mirroring the style of CARE. Can I start? \r\n\r\nA brief introduction: My name is Manas, currently a second-year undergraduate student at IIT Guwahati. I have experience with MERN and NEXTJS technologies. Previously, I participated in an inter IIT competition where my team secured the 2nd position with a NEXTJS project. I'm eager to contribute to this project under your guidance. \r\n\r\nThank you!\""
