      "text": "I investigated the issue, so when the token expires, the user is logged out and redirected to the page /session-expired.\r\nSo in this case all works correctly.\r\nThe issue occurs for logged-in users if manually enter /session-expired in the URL.\r\nUsers see a 404 page because in the router configuration for logged-in users, there is no such route (session-expired)\r\nSo possible solution is to not allow logged-in users to enter this route, it should be allowed only for non-logged users.\r\nI need your approval @rithviknishad "
