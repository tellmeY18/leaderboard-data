And if the user recommends a  procedures/investigation in the list, show a message saying \"this procedures/investigation is already scheduled for the patient\".\r\nSince this is a separate effort, breaking it into a separate issue #8499 \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to take up the issue @aSriram199 "

Having a 4th category for \"actively dying\" is important to understand the number of patients admitted, where the goal for healthcare providers is not to treat the patient to recovery but to provide the patient care so the patient can have a comfortable death. \n\nHaving this classification is patients in important to make sense of patient outcomes. Where ever you have higher % of actively dying patients, % of expired in outcome will also be high. \n\nEarlier we were using the term \"comfort care\" for the classification. However using comfort care is not correct here because it is a wider term that may include patients actively dying or other patients that may be suffering from a disease like a viral infection that may not have any active treatment options. Some of such patients may recover. Hence the definition is \"comfort care\" is too wide. \"Actively dying\" is defined very specifically as patients that are dying. \n\nFor analytics we will have 5 categories \nMild\nModerate\nCritical\nComfort care\nActively dying. \n\n "

This OP number will be the same for any immediate follow ups recommended, usually within 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nYou can think of every hospital maintaining 3 separate registers- \r\n1. patient registry (MRD No.)\r\n2. IP registry and\r\n3. OP Registry\r\n\r\nCurrent need:\r\n\r\nSince CARE is adopted only by smaller hospitals, they may have a more simplified approach to patient registries. What we gather is that hospitals may not be keeping separate OP registers but only patient registry (MRD No.) and IP registry. Hence currently, we can retain the existing fields in CARE for IP and OP numbers and allow users to type in the MRD No. within the OP field if the hospital does not have a separate OP Numbering system.\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "@vishisht-dubey \r\n\r\nThe message that you suggested would be great when a Local doctor is trying to reach a doctor at the hub.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Doctor Connect feature allows communication between different stakeholders. For eg:\r\n- Local doctor to hub doctor\r\n- Hub doctor to local doctor\r\n- Hub doctor to the local nurse\r\n- local nurse to the local doctor\r\n\r\nSo we need a message that holds good in all these above scenarios. A simple message like the one below works well for all.\r\n\"Dr/ms/mr <name of doctor/nurse>\r\n\r\nI have a query regarding a patient.\r\n\r\n< link to patient file >\"\r\n\r\nKeeping the above scenarios in mind, can you see how to improve the message?\r\n\r\n2) The feature to allow WhatsApp routing when the user clicks on the card was introduced after studying user patterns. Doctors generally prefer using communication over WhatsApp. Especially when using CARE on phones, it's very difficult to click precisely on the icon. So allowing users to click anywhere in the card makes it easier. My recommendation is we leave it as is.\r\n\r\n"

Up-titration and down-titration. Up-titration is when medicine dosage is slowly increased, and down-titration is when patient is being veined off a medication. In the former, the user is moving dosage from min to max, while in the later the reverse. Hence for users indicating dosage as Min and max may be confusing.\r\n\r\nTo know more on Drug Titration, you may refer to the scientific paper; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967860/ "

      "text": "**Relevance of \"recommend discharge\"**\r\nThe reason we have an option to Note \"Recommend Discharge\" in log update and then a separate \"Discharge from CARE\" option is because in most cases, the Treating physician would clear the patient for discharge, but the actual discharge may only happen after one of multiple of the following events are done:\r\n1) The patient is on an infusion (medication given through drip) and the doctors may have asked nurse to wait 2-3 hours for drip to complete before sending the patient\r\n2) The patients bill may need to be settled\r\n3) The patient insurance claim process maybe ongoing\r\netc. \r\n\r\nTherefore the actual discharge (noted in CARE through \"discharge from CARE\" on patient dashboard) may only be done hours after the treating physician recommends discharge. \r\n\r\n**To-Do**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Design a flag for \"recommended Discharge\" to be visible on the patient list and patient dashboard. the design may be kept consistent with the design for \"Action\". refer to #5272 . or better the design of actions may be reimagined keeping this use-case also in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "Clarification on the Issue:\r\n\r\n**How the Review Feature should work:**\r\n- The user must be able to set a review time in the consultation/edit consultation form. Or later on in a log update form.\r\n- Once the review time is set, then within that time if a Log Update is not filed for the patient, then the \"Review Missed\" Badge must appear on the patient card.\r\n- When a log update is filed for the patient, the preselected review time must come pre-filled in the 'review after' field in log update.\r\n- With every log update filed, the review clock must reset.\r\n- If the user, the the log update doesnt edit the 'review after' field, the same interval will continue for review, with the review call resetting with every log update.\r\n\r\nEg: I file a 1 hr review in consultation form. I file a log update in half an hr. The log update form will come prefilled with 1hr in review after field. I can choose to edit it to 2 hrs. Then once i save the log update, the clock for review must reset. If no logupdate is filed in another 2 hrs, the \"review missed\" label must appear on the patient grid in patient list. Then once i file a log update, the clock must be reset again with whatever time is mentioned for review in the latest log update.\r\n\r\n**Issues in CARE now - to be resolved**\r\n\r\n- [ ] When I select a review after time in consultation form, and later open the edit consultation form, I see the review after field as blank. I must be able to see the review time i had set previously and also have the option to edit it.\r\n- [ ] When i edit the consultation form to add/edit review time, such time must be considered from the time I edited the consultation, and not the time the original consultation was filed.\r\n- [ ] When a review is missed, an a \"review Missed\" flag appears on patient card, the flag must dissappear once I file a log update. \r\n- [ ] The log update form must come pre-filled with the previoud review time set (either on the consultation form, or on the previous log update)- the user must have option to edit it. \r\n- [ ] The \"review missed\" flag must come right below the patients name on the patient dashboard as well (https://care.coronasafe.in/facility/7ab27974-32c8-4e36-bdf9-dbf102524718/patient/cc52390c-ac8a-4af5-9806-f3df7ee1795a/consultation/7037609e-3c25-45ed-bfd8-e01c346cbd45)\r\n\r\n"
