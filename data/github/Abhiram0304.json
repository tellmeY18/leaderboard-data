      "text": "Hello @nihal467 and Everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm a second-year CSE undergrad at NIT Andhra Pradesh, India. I have proficient skills in Full-stack Web Development, particularly in the MERN stack, and I use Tailwind CSS and Material UI for highly responsive UI designs. I have experience in developing projects using these technologies.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'm well-versed in database management with MySQL and PostgreSQL, utilizing ORMs like Prisma for efficient data handling. Moreover, I employ Zod validation for robust input validation, ensuring data integrity and security.\r\n\r\nI came across the \"Enhance the Doctor Notes Feature in the Patient Consultation Page\" (#7159) project for GSoC'24, and I believe I can make valuable contributions to it. Could you please suggest any initial issues or paths where I can start contributing?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nEmail: tanneriabhi@gmail.com\r\nHere is my best work: https://study-notion-olive.vercel.app/\r\n"
